description: Detective Paul Harley investigates cases that go beyond your standard-issue
  crimes and misdemeanors -- his inquiries often veer into the realm of the supernatural.
  In the novel Fire-Tongue, Harley finds himself up against a shadowy secret society
  that will stop at nothing to achieve world domination. Will he be able to thwart
  their nefarious plot before it's too late?
